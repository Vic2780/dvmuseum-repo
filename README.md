on December 23rd, 2024, highbrow made an announcement regarding the termination of Dragon Village Museum Notion website.
<br><br>
<i>"Dragon Village Museum was originally created as an internal resource for the development team to organize settings and lore, but it was opened to help Tamers understand the game settings and lore, and many Tamers visited Dragon Village Museum. However, starting on January 1, 2025, we ask for your understanding, as it will be converted into an internal resource to strengthen its functionality and manage it more systematically. After accurately structuring it as an internal resource, we will discuss whether to reopen it and make further announcements. We kindly ask for your understanding again, even though it may cause some disappointment."</i>
<br><br>
on January 1st, 2025, highbrow closed the Dragon Village Museum to the public. this repository is a collection of downloads of all the Dragon Village Museum webpages before its closure, minus dragon pages. if you are seeking specifically dragon pages, i and WhiChi2720 have archived them all on the <a href="https://dragon-village-collection.fandom.com/wiki/Dragon_Village_Collection_Wiki">Dragon Village Fandom Wiki</a>, where you can find a link to each archived museum page at the bottom of each dragon's Fandom Wiki page.
